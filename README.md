<b>About MCProtocolLib</b>
--------

mc-protocol-lib is a simple library for communicating with a Minecraft client/server. It aims to allow people to make custom bots, clients, or servers for Minecraft easily.


<b>Server List Ping</b>
--------

When you receive a server list ping packet when listening to a server, respond by calling connection.disconnect(Util.formatPingResponse(motd, players, maxplayers));

When you are sending a ping request, do the following:
  connection.send(new PacketServerPing());
  connection.send(Util.prepareClientPingData(connection.getHost(), connection.getPort()));
